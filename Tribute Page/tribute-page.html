        <h3>The time line of Alan Turing's life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1912</strong> - Alan Mathison Turing is born on June 23 in Maida Vale, London, England.</li>

          <li><strong>1926</strong> - Attends Sherborne School, where his interest in mathematics and science begins to flourish.</li>

          <li><strong>1931</strong> - Enrolls at King's College, University of Cambridge, studying mathematics.</li>

          <li><strong>1935</strong> - Turing submits his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" to the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, which lays the foundation for modern computer science and introduces the concept of the Turing machine.</li>

          <li><strong>1936</strong> - Turing begins his Ph.D. studies at Princeton University under Alonzo Church.</li>
          
          <li><strong>1938</strong> - Completes his Ph.D. at Princeton and returns to Cambridge.</li>

          <li><strong>1939</strong> - World War II begins. Turing joins the British Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, where he works to decipher German codes, particularly the Enigma machine, greatly contributing to Allied victory.</li>

          <li><strong>1945</strong> - The war ends. Turing begins working on designs for electronic stored-program digital computers.</li>

          <li><strong>1948</strong> - Turing joins the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in London, where he contributes to the development of early computers.</li>

          <li><strong>1950</strong> - Publishes the paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," which introduces the Turing Test, a criterion for determining whether a machine exhibits intelligent behavior.</li>

          <li><strong>1952</strong> - Turing is arrested and charged with "gross indecency" for his homosexual relationship, which was illegal in the UK at the time.</li>

          <li><strong>1952</strong> - Turing undergoes chemical castration as an alternative to imprisonment.</li>

          <li><strong>1954</strong> - Alan Turing dies on June 7 from cyanide poisoning. His death is officially ruled as suicide, though there is speculation about accidental ingestion.</li>

          <li><strong>2013</strong> - Alan Turing is posthumously granted a royal pardon by Queen Elizabeth II, acknowledging the injustice of his conviction for homosexuality, marking a significant step towards recognizing his contributions and legacy.</li>
